<h2>Running the executable desktop app on Windows</h2>
<p>If Windows gives a message that it prevented the app from running, the button <em>proceed</em> anyway can be clicked. Windows will always show this when an executable has not been registered with Microsoft. Unfortunately, signing an executable with Microsoft can cost a significant amount of money, so I (Jason Schneider) did not get the desktop app signed and registered with Microsoft. However, if a user has any questions about the legitimacy of the desktop app, the user can contact me (Jason Schneider) at jschneider@dcccd.edu, and I will be happy to answer any questions.</p>
